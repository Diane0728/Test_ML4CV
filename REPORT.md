# VLM Quantization Project Report

## Executive Summary

This project implements post-training dynamic quantization for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), specifically targeting BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) models. The implementation demonstrates significant performance improvements through INT8 quantization while maintaining acceptable accuracy levels.

## 1. Post-Training Dynamic Quantization Implementation

### 1.1 Quantization Strategy
- **Method**: PyTorch Dynamic Quantization (`torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic`)
- **Target Precision**: INT8 for linear layers
- **Scope**: Post-training quantization (no retraining required)
- **Hardware Support**: CPU-optimized with CUDA FP16 fallback

### 1.2 Key Features
- **Dynamic Weight Quantization**: Weights quantized to INT8, activations remain FP32
- **Layer-Specific Targeting**: Focus on `torch.nn.Linear` layers (most compute-intensive)
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Automatic FP16 CUDA fallback when INT8 unavailable
- **Memory Optimization**: Reduced model size by ~50-75%
